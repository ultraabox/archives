# BruceBox
**PLEASE READ**.

At the time this README was updated, I have had enough of BruceBox. This forked repo all started as a test of trying to run a Modded BeepBox fork experiment almost a year ago, at the time BeepBox and all existing mods around only supported 4 channels, and nothing bigger or even smaller. That is to say, BruceBox is a fork of ModBox 1 on GitHub. This is why you're not seeing the fancy 8 channels, Custom Harmony, and FM as seen in everything else.

BruceBox is also infamous for its controversey across the BeepBox Discord (the big BeepBox server that I'm currently banned from), among other places including the wiki. I also remember abandoning a forum on Forumotion and making a fake "EAS Scenario" about BeepBox being hijacked, using only Bandicam and an EAS alert simulator that doesn't even have a voice function.

I'm just going to stop developing BruceBox for an indefinite time. If you have some important BruceBox music you need to manage, feel free to do so. Apologies for removing the instructions on the README, but those were just clones of what's on the HTML.
